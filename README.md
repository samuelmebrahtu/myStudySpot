# myStudySpot

**myStudySpot** is a simple web app for students who get bored of studying at the same old spots on the University of Birmingham campus. 
* With the click of a button, users can discover new places to study or work.
* The app provides the name of each spot, pictures, and a Google Maps embed to help users find their way. 
* While the app is currently limited to this basic feature, more will be added and refined based on user feedback.
