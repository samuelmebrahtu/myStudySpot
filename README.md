# myStudySpot

**myStudySpot** is a simple web app for students who get bored of studying at the same old spots on the University of Birmingham campus.\
Feel free to give it a try [here](https://admirable-paletas-0c5605.netlify.app/)
* With the click of a button, users can discover new places to study or work.
* The app provides the name of each spot, pictures, and directions to help users find their way.
* It also lets users know whether you need a student ID to access the building.
* While the app is currently limited to this basic feature, more will be added and refined based on user feedback.
